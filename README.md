After a Day out with the Camera, I end up with a ton of pictures. After selecting the best pictures I delete the bad pictures. This is a time consuming process. However, the RAW pictures have to be filtered again, this process takes a long time. 

Hence, this code does the work by obtaining the location of the selected JPG files & filters the CR2 Files for final review & deletion.
